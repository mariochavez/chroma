A small example usage

```ruby
require "logger"

# Requiere Chroma Ruby client.
require "chroma-db"

# Configure Chroma's host. Here you can specify your own host.
Chroma.connect_host = "http://localhost:8000"
Chroma.logger = Logger.new($stdout)
Chroma.log_level = Chroma::LEVEL_ERROR

# Check current Chrome server version
version = Chroma::Resources::Database.version
puts version

# Create a new collection
collection = Chroma::Resources::Collection.create(collection_name, {lang: "ruby", gem: "chroma-db"})

# Add embeddings
embeddings = [
  Chroma::Resources::Embedding.new(id: "1", embedding: [1.3, 2.6, 3.1], metadata: {client: "chroma-rb"}, document: "ruby"),
  Chroma::Resources::Embedding.new(id: "2", embedding: [3.7, 2.8, 0.9], metadata: {client: "chroma-rb"}, document: "rails")
]
collection.add(embeddings)
```
